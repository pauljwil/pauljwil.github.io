This page includes samples of my software development projects and technical writing.

## Software Development

### Golang

[RethinkDB Prometheus Exporter](https://github.com/pauljwil/rethinkdb-prometheus-exporter)

This fork of an existing RethinkDB exporter adds new metrics for the `current_issues` table and table sizes, as well as unit testing.

### Python

[Replacer CLI](https://github.com/pauljwil/replacer-cli)

This CLI application allows you to find and replace text inside multiple files within a directory.

## Technical Writing

### API Documentation

[Mirantis Kubernetes Engine 3.6.2 API Documentation](https://docs.mirantis.com/mke/3.6/api-ref/mke-api-3-6-2.html)

I redesigned the API docs to present with Redoc rather than Swagger, and maintain the page throughout the release process.

[Sidescale API documentation](../sidescale-api)

This is an example of API documentation I built for a cloud services platform which makes use of the Apache CloudStack API.

### General Documentation

[Use Helm Charts with Mirantis Secure Registry](https://docs.mirantis.com/msr/2.9/ops/use-helm-charts.html)

This example demonstrates a combination of conceptual, procedural, and reference documentation.

### Release Notes

[Mirantis Kubernetes Engine 3.4.4 Release Notes](https://docs.mirantis.com/mke/3.4/release-notes/3-4-4.html)

This is an example of release notes for a patch release that includes new features, bug fixes, and known issues.

### QuickStart Guide

[Install Mirantis Container Runtime on Ubuntu](https://docs.mirantis.com/mcr/20.10/qs-ubuntu.html)

This example gives users only what they need to get Mirantis Container Runtime installed and running in under an hour.
