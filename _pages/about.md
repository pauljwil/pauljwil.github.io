I've always had a passion for communication, which has shaped my diverse
pursuits in music and philosophy. During my time as a graduate student, I
focused on analytic and classical Indian Buddhist philosophy, delving into
topics such as the philosophy of emotion, moral psychology, and personal
identity. One particular area of interest for me was exploring the nature of
compassion.

Music has been an integral part of my life since I was young. I began playing
electric bass at the age of twelve, studied music composition in college, and
had the opportunity to perform with various groups along the way. After
completing my studies, I recorded two albums featuring my original compositions.

Currently residing in Portland, OR with my wife, two stepsons, and our adorable
little Chiweenie, Fernie, we take every opportunity to explore the beauty of the
Pacific Northwest.

Simplicity, humility, and effective communication are values that hold great
importance to me.
