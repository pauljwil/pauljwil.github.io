I've spent much of my adult life undertaking projects in music and philosophy. The common thread in all my pursuits is a passion for communication.

As a graduate student, I studied analytic and classical Indian Buddhist philosophy. My masters thesis dealt with the philosophy of emotion, moral psychology, and personal identity, focussing on the nature of compassion.

I've played music since I was a kid. I began learning electric bass when I was twelve, studied music composition as an undergraduate, and played in numerous groups along the way. I recorded two albums of all original music soon after finishing college.

These days I live in Portland, OR with my wife and two stepsons. When the weather's nice we like to explore the many bodies of water around here as much as we can. Some of the things I value are simplicity, humility, and effective communication.
