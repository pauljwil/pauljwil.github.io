I've always had a passion for communication, which has shaped my diverse pursuits in technology, music, and philosophy. During my time as a graduate student, I focused on analytic and classical Indian Buddhist philosophy, exploring topics such as the philosophy of emotion, moral psychology, and personal identity. One particular area of interest for me was exploring the nature of compassion.

Music has been an integral part of my life since I was young. I began playing electric bass when I was twelve, studied music composition in college, and had the opportunity to perform with various groups along the way. After completing my studies, I recorded two albums featuring my original compositions.

My current focus on technical communication, engineering, and content architecture brings together the creative and analytical rigor of my past pursuits, shaping an enjoyable career that I hope contributes meaningfully to the tech comm community.

Currently residing in Portland, OR with my wife, two stepsons, and our adorable little chiweenie, we take every opportunity to explore the beauty of the Pacific Northwest.

Simplicity, humility, and effective communication are values that hold great importance to me.
