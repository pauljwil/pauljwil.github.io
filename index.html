<h1>Hi, I'm Paul.</h1>
<p>I'm a software developer and writer living in the Pacific Northwest with two
   years' development experience and over 10 years' experience in technical,
   academic, and legal writing.</p>
<p>I've worked for the past three years as a full-time and freelance technical
   writer, focussing primarily on cloud computing, containerization, and
   orchestration technologies. For the last year, I've been informally interning
   on the Mirantis Secure Registry development team, where I've worked on
   numerous bug fixes and two net new features. My expertise lies in
   docs-as-code tooling, API documentation, and maintaining large and complex
   documentation sets, with a passion for information architecture and user
   experience.</p>
<p>On the development side, I've worked primarily in Golang at Mirantis, and using
   Python before that. The features that I've worked on focus on metrics
   collection for both company and customer use. I'm currently building a
   Prometheus exporter into Mirantis Secure Registry so that users can track the
   health of their MSR clusters.</p>
