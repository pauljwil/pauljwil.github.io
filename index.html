<h1>Hi, I'm Paul.</h1>
<p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am an accomplished writer and software developer
   with a diverse background in technical, academic, and legal writing. With
   over 10 years of writing experience and two years dedicated to scripting and
   software development, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise, writing
   proficiency, and a deep understanding of cloud computing, containerization,
   and orchestration technologies.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, I've been immersed in the world of technical
   writing, honing my skills as both a full-time professional and a
   freelance writer. My passion lies in docs-as-code tooling, API documentation,
   and the management of complex documentation sets. I have a keen eye for
   building information architecture that ensures users can easily navigate and
   understand complex technical concepts.</p>
<p>At Mirantis, I've had the opportunity to make a significant impact on both
   the development and documentation fronts. As an integral part of the
   Mirantis Secure Registry development team, I've successfully delivered
   critical bug fixes and implemented two new features. Leveraging Go as my
   primary language, I'm currently focused on building a Prometheus exporter
   into Mirantis Secure Registry. This enhancement will empower users to monitor
   the health of their MSR clusters with ease and precision.</p>
<p>I take great pride in my ability to deliver high-quality documentation and
   code that not only meets technical requirements but also enhances
   user experiences. Feel free to explore my portfolio to see examples of my
   work and how I can contribute to your projects.</p>
