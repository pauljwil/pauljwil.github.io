<h1>Hi, I'm Paul.</h1>
<p>I'm a software developer and writer with two years' development experience
   and over 10 years' experience in technical, academic, and legal writing.</p>
<p>I've worked for the past three years as a full-time and freelance technical
   writer, focussing primarily on cloud computing, containerization, and
   orchestration technologies. For the last year, I've been working part time
   on the Mirantis Secure Registry development team, where I've contributed
   numerous bug fixes and two new features. My expertise lies in docs-as-code
   tooling, API documentation, and maintaining large and complex documentation
   sets, with a passion for information architecture and user experience.</p>
<p>On the development side, I've worked primarily in Go at Mirantis, using
   Python before that. The features that I've developed deliver usage
   metrics for both company and customer use. I'm currently building a
   Prometheus exporter into Mirantis Secure Registry so that users can track the
   health of their MSR clusters.</p>
