<h1>Hi, I'm Paul.</h1>
<p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a skilled software developer and writer with a
   diverse background in technical, academic, and legal writing. With over two
   years of hands-on development experience and a strong focus on cloud
   computing, containerization, and orchestration technologies, I bring a
   unique blend of technical expertise and writing proficiency.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, I've been immersed in the world of technical
   writing, honing my skills as both a full-time professional and a
   freelance writer. My passion lies in docs-as-code tooling, API documentation,
   and the management of complex documentation sets. I have a keen eye for
   building information architecture that ensures users can easily navigate and
   understand complex technical concepts.</p>
<p>At Mirantis, I've had the opportunity to make a significant impact on both
   the development and documentation fronts. As an integral part of the
   Mirantis Secure Registry development team, I've successfully delivered
   critical bug fixes and implemented two new features. Leveraging Go as my
   primary language, I'm currently focused on building a Prometheus exporter
   into Mirantis Secure Registry. This enhancement will empower users to monitor
   the health of their MSR clusters with ease and precision.</p>
<p>I take great pride in my ability to deliver high-quality code and
   documentation that not only meets technical requirements but also enhances
   user experiences. Feel free to explore my portfolio to see examples of my
   work and how I can contribute to your projects.</p>
